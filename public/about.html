<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Vince has always been fascinated with the "big questions" in life:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Is there ultimate purpose?</li>
  <li>Why is there something, rather than nothing?</li>
  <li>What happens after I die?</li>
</ol>

<p>In 2018, he completed his Master's in Philosophy, and pursued a career working with high school dropouts. However, recently, he discovered that his skills in problem solving sparked a curiosity in the world of coding. It's at this time that he's now engaged in this Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp, in order to verify if this is a world that he would like to venture further into. Maybe one day he could acquire the skills to build out a philosophy curriculum for children and adolescents.  </p>

<p>Currently, Vince resides in the Salt Lake area with his wife (a Marriage and Family Therapist) and his two young kids. His passions include movies, getting curious about the outdoors, and watching the Pittsburgh Steelers.</p>
