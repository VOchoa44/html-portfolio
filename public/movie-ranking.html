<h1>Vince's Soul Care Movies</h1>
<h2>My Top Three</h2>
<hr />
<h3>The Tree of Life</h3>
<p>A coming of age movie that explores human value, loss, and manhood.</p>
<h3>Silence</h3>
<p>Where is God? Is He good? Can I endure? This film unpacks these questions (and more)!
</p>
<h3>Fight Club</h3>
<p>I'm not supposed to talk about it, but Tyler Durden wrestles with whether or not to embrace reality, or to choose an idiosyncratic concept of meaning. </p>
